    <p>What our jobseekers say:</p>

    <blockquote><em>‘What I have taken away from the training: Realising that you have something to offer an employer and selling yourself.  Be confident in your approach to the job you would like to have a look at.  Look for things you can do, and offer your person, not your injury or inability.’</em></blockquote>
    <blockquote><em>‘I still feel hesitant about approaching employers.  But at least I can approach other networking groups.’</em></blockquote>
    <blockquote><em>‘It has helped reassure me about my efforts job seeking, and that I am on the right track’.</em></blockquote>
    <blockquote><em>‘I feel more confident now that I understand more about what is expected of me and how to achieve my goals in job searching, by using skills learned in sessions.’</em></blockquote>
    <blockquote><em>‘I now know how to write a cover letter.’</em></blockquote>
