      <p><strong>What our job seekers say</strong></p>
      <blockquote>What I have taken away from the training: Realising that you have something to offer an employer and selling yourself.  Be confident in your approach to the job you would like to have a look at.  Look for things you can do, and offer your person, not your injury or inability.</blockquote>
